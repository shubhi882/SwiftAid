    {
      title: 'Assess the Injury',
      instruction: 'Check for signs of fracture: severe pain, swelling, deformity, difficulty moving, or bone protruding through skin. For sprains, look for swelling, bruising, and pain during movement.',
      note: 'If unsure whether it\'s a fracture or sprain, treat it as a fracture.'
    },
    {
      title: 'Immobilize the Injury',
      instruction: 'Keep the injured area still and support it in the position found. Do not attempt to realign bones or joints. For sprains, follow RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.',

    },
    {
      title: 'Create Support',
      instruction: 'For arm or shoulder injuries, use a sling. For leg injuries, use splints if available. Pad the splints for comfort and secure them firmly but not too tight.',
      note: 'Improvised splints can be made from firm materials like rolled newspapers or boards.'
    },
    {
      title: 'Monitor and Comfort',
      instruction: 'Check circulation beyond the injury regularly. Look for numbness, tingling, or blue/pale skin. Keep the person warm and comfortable.',
